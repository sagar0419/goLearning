## This repository showcases GoLang code I developed while actively practicing and honing my GoLang skills.


### Maps Questions.

1. **Word Frequency Counter:** Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a map where keys are words in the string, and values are the number of times each word appears.

2. **Key Existence Check:** Write a program that initializes a map with some key-value pairs. Check if a given key exists in the map, and print the corresponding value if it exists.

3. **Reverse a Map:** Given a map of string-to-int (map[string]int), write a program to create a new map that reverses the key-value relationship, i.e., an int-to-string map (map[int]string).

4. **Count Character Frequency:** Write a function that counts the frequency of each character in a string and stores the result in a map.

5. **Sum of Values:** Write a function that calculates the sum of all integer values in a map where the map is map[string]int.

6. **Merge Two Maps:** Write a function that merges two maps. If both maps have the same key, the value from the second map should overwrite the value from the first map.

7. **Find Keys by Value:** Write a function that takes a map of map[string]int and a target value as inputs and returns a slice of all keys that have the target value.

8. **Count Words in a Sentence:** Write a function that takes a sentence and returns a map where keys are unique words (case-insensitive), and values are their counts.

9. **Find Duplicates in a Slice:** Given a slice of integers, create a map to count occurrences of each number and identify which numbers are duplicates.

10. **Map of Maps:** Write a program that uses a map of maps (e.g., map[string]map[string]int) to store and retrieve hierarchical data, like categories and subcategories.

11. **Flatten a Map of Slices:** Given a map of map[string][]int, write a function to flatten it into a single slice containing all the integers.

12. **Custom Sorting by Value:** Write a function that sorts a map of map[string]int by its values in descending order and returns the sorted keys in a slice.

13. **Convert Map to JSON:** Write a program that takes a map and converts it into a JSON string using Go's encoding/json package.

14. **Nested Maps for JSON Parsing:** Parse a JSON string into a map and access nested elements using a sequence of keys.

15. **Cache System with Map:** Implement a simple in-memory cache using a map. Add functionalities for setting a key-value pair, retrieving a value by key, and removing expired entries based on a given time-to-live (TTL).


```
    Add a new employee.
    Update employee details.
    Retrieve details by ID.
    Delete an employee by ID.
```
