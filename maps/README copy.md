### Questions with maps.

1. Word Frequency Counter: Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a map where keys are words in the string, and values are the number of times each word appears.

2. Key Existence Check: Write a program that initializes a map with some key-value pairs. Check if a given key exists in the map, and print the corresponding value if it exists.

3. Reverse a Map: Given a map of string-to-int (map[string]int), write a program to create a new map that reverses the key-value relationship, i.e., an int-to-string map (map[int]string).

4. Count Character Frequency: Write a function that counts the frequency of each character in a string and stores the result in a map.

5. Sum of Values: Write a function that calculates the sum of all integer values in a map where the map is map[string]int.
