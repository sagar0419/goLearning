## This repository showcases GoLang code I developed while actively practicing and honing my GoLang skills.


### Interface Questions.

1. **Basic** Create an interface Greeter with one method Greet() string.
    * Implement Greeter for a Person struct where Greet returns the personâ€™s name.
2. **Animal Sounds** Define an interface Animal with a method Speak() string.
    * Implement Animal for Dog, Cat, and Cow structs. Test by creating a slice of Animal and calling Speak() on each.
3. **Simple Shape Interface** Create a Shape interface with methods Area() float64 and Perimeter() float64.
    * Implement Shape for a Rectangle and Circle struct.
4. **Reusable Printer** Write a function PrintDetails that accepts an interface with a Details() string method.
    * Use it with structs like Book and Car that implement the Details method.
5. **Multiple Structs with One Interface** Define an interface Transport with methods Start() string and Stop() string.
    * Implement it for Car, Bike, and Bus structs.
    * Write a function that takes a slice of Transport and calls Start and Stop for each.
6. **Empty Interface** Create a function Describe that accepts an interface{} (empty interface) and prints:
    * The type of the input.
    * The value of the input.
    * Test with integers, strings, and custom structs.
